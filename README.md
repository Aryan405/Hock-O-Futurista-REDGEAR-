Problem Statement
People with visual impairment have a difficult time going about places on their own. They always feel a
need to be accompanied by a helper to reach their destination safely. Ascertain a solution to ease their
lives by designing a system to be embedded into a walking stick such that it continuously scans the
environment and provides feedback to the person. Try and replace a human helper with a designed
system that is as reliable as an actual helper. Objective
We are going to make a Smart Walking Stick for the people with visual disability . This stick is far better
than the traditional sticks that they use everyday . We selected Stick for developing a product because
Stick is considered as the Third Eye for Blind People . Novelty
The general Blind Sticks that are available in the market are capable of finding obstacles only when they
touch the objects physically that may sometime result in accident . But the Smart Stick that we
developed consists of the following advance features :- 1. It is capable of finding obstacles that may be present in Front , Right and Left direction of the Blind
Man without any physical touch with the object . Our product can detect object from the distance
of 1 meter and alerts the Blind Man by Vibrating the Stick and Buzzer Sound . 2. Our Smart Stick is also capable of detecting water present in front of Blind People to avoid any
type of accident caused due to slippery surface. 3. We have also included IR Remote that will help the man to find the stick if he losses it .Whenever
he press the button in IR Remote a beep sound starts that helps the man to get his stick back . 4. Though the wavelength of Red Light is highest , so we have connected a Red Light on the stick so
that the person coming from the front side can see it from distance and become cautious that a
Visually Disable Man is coming . Target Community
It will be very much helpful for blind people , the people with visual impairment , old people etc. This
product would be considered as boon for Blind People and it will make them independent . Technical Implementation
For developing the Smart Stick we have used the following Electronic components like :
1. Arduino Uno x 1
2. Ultra Sonic Sensors(HC-SR04) x 3
3. Water Sensor x 1
4. Buzzer x 1
5. Vibration Motor x 1
6. IR Remote and sensor x 1
7. Red LED Light
8. Jumper Wires
9. Power Source
Software Required :
Arduino IDE
Tinker Cad
When the person starts walking on the road with the help of smart stick the Ultra Sonic Sensors used in
the stick starts detecting any obstacles by transmitting and receiving ultrasonic sounds . If it detect
any object that is less than 1 meter from the stick it sends signal to the micro-controller and then the
Buzzer starts Beeping and Vibration Motor starts Vibrating the Stick . We have made the buzzer sound
different for obstacles from different directions like if the Right Sensor detects the obstacle then the
buzzer will starts beeping having long delays and the same mechanism used for other two Ultra Sonic
sensors also . Now we know that ultrasonic sensor is not capable of detecting watery surface or any
small watery pothole present on Road . To detect this we have connected a Water Detector at the end
tip of our Smart Stick . Whenever it detects any type of watery surface it informs the Blind Man by
starting the Buzzer by playing unique sound pattern . Many times we have noticed that stick falls from
the hand of Blind Person and it becomes difficult for them to find the stick . So ,to overcome this
problem we have connected an IR Sensor Detector on the stick and we give an IR Remote to the Blind
Man . Whenever he faces this type of situation he just have to press a button and then the Buzzer starts
beeping and the man can easily find the stick by listening the Buzzer Sound . We have also connected a
Red Led Light on the stick so that person coming from front side can know that a Blind Man is coming
and he become more cautious . Approximately 750 INR is required , for developing a product that consists of the above features and
specifications . Outcome / Social Impact
The Smart Stick that we have developed will hugely impact the life of Visually Impaired and Old people
by making their life much easier than earlier . With the help of this product Visually Impaired people will
become much more mobile and ultimately this will make them more Independent . This product will
increase the rate of employment and opportunities of Visually Disable people and it also helps in
prevention of the accidents caused due to Blind People . Future Aspects
This product is very cost effective and can be easily used by the any Section of Society . But we can also
do some further advancements to make this Smart Stick more compact and can also include more
specifications . A GPS / GSM Module can be connected that will help the Blind Man to communicate
and send his real time location to his caretaker / family members in case of any trouble or being lost . Secondly , this product cannot detect if there is a Hole present on the path and also it cannot detect
which type of hurdle is present on the path . It can only detect obstacles . So , we can use extra
sensors/device or new technology in the near future that will remove these cons and make it more
advance . Further aspects of this system can be improved via wireless connectivity between the system
components
